Open sol.py in a text editor and change the server, serverport and password.
Copy sol.py to the \xbmc\scripts folder on your xbox.


3. Optional: (www.plusminusnull.de/sol/xbmc/)
   
   If you want a 'Shutdown PC'-Button on the opening menu of xbmc then
   copy the skin folder to your xbmc folder and copy strings.xml to
   \xbmc\language\'yourlanguage' on your xbox.
