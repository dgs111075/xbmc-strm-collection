NOTE:

This mod is only for people who have Media Center Extender for Xbox installed on their xbox.  This is not XBMC, it is a product released by Microsoft a few years ago that lets xbox users sync up with Windows XP Media Center Edition computers.  If you do not have this program, this mod won't do you a lot of good.  If you would like to purchase this program, I suggest looking on ebay.  They're pretty common on there, but have been discontinued by microsoft.  You will also need to have the Media Center Edition of Windows XP installed on a computer hooked up to the network.




INSTALLATION:

To install, simply FTP to your xbox and copy this MC360 folder over the original.  Restart, and you should be good to go.

ENABLING MOD:

To enable this, you must go to the MC360 Guide (start button) -> Personal Settings -> Skin Mods Settings and enable the MCE button.  Now, on the media blade, you should see a button for Media Center Extender.  Enable this, and then select "Specify Media Center Folder..." and navigate to the your Media Center Extender folder, most likely named "Media Center Extender for Xbox."  Press Done and exit out of there.
